It serves as a strategic tool for decision-makers to assess the health and progress of individual projects and their collective impact on organizational objectives. The project portfolio typically includes key information such as project objectives, timelines, budgets, resource allocation, and risk assessments. By maintaining a well-managed project portfolio, businesses can prioritize, monitor, and optimize their projects to ensure alignment with overall business strategies. This holistic approach enables effective resource management, risk mitigation, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, ultimately contributing to the success and growth of the organization.
